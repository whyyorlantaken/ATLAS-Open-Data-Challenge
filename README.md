# Challenge: ATLAS Open Data

## Workgroup
This repository contains a possible solution for one of the twelve challenges proposed in the Latin American Hackaton CoAfina 2024. Said solution was developed by RCC, a group of three physics students from Yachay Tech university. They are:

- Mariannly Marquez
- Britney Robalino Ramírez
- Yorlan Males-Araujo

## Problem
In short, the problem consisted of choosing one (or more) of the notebooks listed [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/atlas-outreach-data-tools/notebooks-collection-opendata/tree/master/13-TeV-examples/python/), and make the physics and code parts of it more accessible to, for example, a student that might not necessarily be that familiar with the topics the notebooks touch on. This might be done by expanding the documentation via adding equations, references, diagrams and *clear explanations*. Additionally, a good translation of the work into Spanish was requested in order not to limit the number of people that can be reached.
